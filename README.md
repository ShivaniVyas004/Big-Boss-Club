BBC System Project

Technologies: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL Database, Notepad++

Created Big Boss Club System which is a martial arts school with hundreds of students. This System fulfill following requirements:

•	There is only one instructor who teaches all classes.
•	Students are given a student number when they join the school.  
  This is stored along with their name, date of birth, the date they joined the school, their mobile number, email, and address.  
•	The school wants to track also the students’ parents (Mother and/or Father). 
  Assume that most students live with their parents. Not all students have parents (some students might be adults so there is no need to keep track of their parents). We need to store also parents’ mobile phone and email address. Parents may also be students.
•	Students pay fees for membership, tests, purchasing products, etc. The system must be able to keep track of all money received from students. The system should be able to show this information for any given date, e.g. by month or within a range such as from Jan 1-Jan 20th.
•	A class is offered for a specific level at a specific time, day of the week.  For example, one class taught on Mondays at 5:00 pm is an intermediate-level class.  Another class taught on Mondays at 6:00 pm is a beginner-level class.  
  A third class taught on Tuesdays at 5:00 pm is an advanced-level class, and so on.  There are different levels of classes. These provided here are only as an example.
•	Students may attend any class at any level during each week so there is no expectation that any particular student will attend any particular class session.  
  Therefore, the actual attendance of students at each individual class meeting must be tracked.
•	Each student holds a rank in the martial arts. The belt color and the date the student awarded each rank needs to be kept in the database. 
  A given rank may be held by many students.  While it is customary to think of a student as having a single rank, it is necessary to track each student’s progress through the ranks.  Therefore, every rank that a student attains is kept in the system.  New students joining the school are automatically given a white belt rank (default).  All ranks have at least one student that has achieved that rank at some time.
